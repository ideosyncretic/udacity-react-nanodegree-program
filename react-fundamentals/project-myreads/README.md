# Readable

This is my project for the React segment of Udacity's React Nanodegree. It fetches books from an API and allows users to search for, and categorize, books that they are currently reading, want to read, or have read.

## Get Started

* Start the front-end server
    - `npm install` or `yarn`
    - `npm start` or `yarn start`
